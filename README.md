Capstone Project: Booking.com Data Analysis and Machine Learning


Project Description
This capstone project involves a comprehensive analysis of data scraped from Booking.com,
followed by SQL queries, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning to predict hotel prices and review scores.
The project is divided into four phases, each with its unique objectives and tasks.

Project Phases
Phase 1: Web Scraping
Web scrape data from Booking.com for 12 cities.
Create three CSV files with hotel data and details.


Phase 2: SQL Queries
Write a series of SQL queries to extract specific information from the data.
Perform various data manipulations and aggregations using SQL.


Phase 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
Combine the data from the three CSV files into one dataframe using pandas.
Conduct a detailed EDA to gain insights into the data.


Phase 4: Machine Learning
Develop machine learning models for predicting hotel prices and review scores.
